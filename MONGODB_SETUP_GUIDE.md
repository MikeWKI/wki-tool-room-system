# MongoDB Configuration for Data Persistence

## 🎯 Overview
Your WKI Tool Room Inventory System now has complete MongoDB integration to ensure data persists through deployments. Here's how to set it up:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Set Environment Variable in Render.com

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Select your backend service** (the one that failed before)
3. **Click "Environment" tab**
4. **Add this environment variable**:
   - **Key**: `MONGODB_URI`
   - **Value**: `mongodb+srv://michaela_db_user:YOUR_PASSWORD@wki-cluster-1.hvfw5be.mongodb.net/WKI-ToolRoomINV-WIC?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=WKI-Cluster-1`
   
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual database user password

### 2. Get Your MongoDB Password

If you don't remember your password:
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas (cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Navigate to **Database Access**
3. Find user `michaela_db_user`
4. Click **Edit** → **Edit Password**
5. Set a new password and copy it

### 3. Deploy on Render

1. After adding the environment variable
2. Click **"Deploy Latest Commit"**
3. Monitor the deployment logs

## 🔍 Expected Log Messages

### Success (MongoDB Connected):
```
🔗 Connected to MongoDB Atlas
🏓 MongoDB connection verified
🔄 Checking for data migration from JSON files...
📊 MongoDB already contains data, skipping migration
✅ Using MongoDB for data persistence
📊 Connected to MongoDB - Data will persist through deployments
```

### Fallback (MongoDB Failed):
```
❌ MongoDB connection failed, falling back to JSON files: [error details]
📁 Created parts.json
📁 Created shelves.json
📁 Created transactions.json
⚠️ Using JSON files - data will be lost on redeployment
```

## 🚀 What This Achieves

### ✅ Data Persistence
- Inventory parts survive deployments
- Transaction history is preserved
- Shelf configurations remain intact
- No data loss during redeployments

### ✅ Automatic Migration
- Existing JSON data migrates to MongoDB automatically
- One-time process - runs only when MongoDB is empty
- Seamless transition from file-based to database storage

### ✅ Fallback Safety
- If MongoDB fails, system continues with JSON files
- No downtime or service interruption
- Clear logging shows which system is active

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration (Optional)

### Custom Database Name
Add this environment variable to override the database name:
```
DB_NAME=YourCustomDatabaseName
```

### Connection Timeout
Add for slower connections:
```
MONGODB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30000
```

## 🧪 Testing Data Persistence

1. **Deploy with MongoDB configured**
2. **Add some test inventory items**
3. **Redeploy your service**
4. **Verify the items are still there**

## 📊 MongoDB Collections Structure

Your database will have these collections:
- **parts**: All inventory items with full details
- **shelves**: Location definitions and descriptions  
- **transactions**: Complete audit trail of all changes

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If MongoDB Connection Fails:
- Check the MONGODB_URI environment variable
- Verify the password is correct
- Ensure your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Check MongoDB Atlas cluster status

### If Data Doesn't Migrate:
- Check deployment logs for migration messages
- Verify JSON files exist in your repository
- MongoDB collections must be empty for migration to run

## 🎉 Success Confirmation

When working correctly, you'll see:
- ✅ Green "Connected to MongoDB" message in logs
- ✅ Data persists after redeployment
- ✅ Faster query performance
- ✅ Professional database reliability

Your inventory system is now production-ready with enterprise-grade data persistence!
